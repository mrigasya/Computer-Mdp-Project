	<h1>Consumer-to-Consumer</h1>
	<p>Consumer-to-consumer (C2C), or customer-to-customer, represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction.

In this case, the third-party platform typically earns their money by charging transaction or listing fees. These businesses benefit from self-propelled growth by motivated buyers and sellers, but face a key challenge in quality control and technology maintenance. Another customersâ€™ benefit is the competition for products. Customers may often find items that are difficult to locate elsewhere. Also, margins can be higher than traditional pricing methods for sellers as there are minimal costs due to the absence of retailers or wholesalers.

Opening a C2C site takes careful planning. Examples of C2C include Craigslist and eBay, who pioneered this model in the early days of the internet. Generally, transactions in this model occur via online platforms (such as PayPal), but often are conducted using social-media networks (e.g., Facebook marketplace) and websites (Craigslist).

The advantages of C2C include:

Availability: It is always available so consumers can shop on demand;
Websites are updated regularly;
Higher profitability: Consumers selling products directly to other consumers can achieve higher profits;
Low transaction cost: Selling via online platforms is much cheaper than the costs incurred on having physical store space;
Direct relationship: Customers can directly contact sellers without having to go through an intermediary.
The disadvantages of C2C include:

Payment may be less secure;
Security issues: There could be theft due to scammers falsely impersonating well known C2C sites;
Lack of quality control of products.</p>
